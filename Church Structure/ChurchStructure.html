        <h3 id="explanation-title">New Testament Church Structure</h3>
        <div id="nt-explanation">
            <p>This chart reflects the biblical model where <strong>Christ</strong> is the head (Ephesians 1:22). <strong>Apostles</strong> and <strong>Prophets</strong> are foundational, equipping the early church (Ephesians 2:20, 4:11).</p>
            <p>Each <strong>Local Assembly</strong> is autonomous (Acts 14:23), led by <strong>Elders</strong> (1 Timothy 3:1-7) who oversee and teach, often including <strong>Pastors</strong> (1 Peter 5:2).</p>
            <p><strong>Evangelists</strong> spread the gospel (Acts 21:8), and <strong>Teachers</strong> instruct (Acts 13:1). <strong>Deacons</strong> serve practical needs (Acts 6:1-6), and <strong>Widows</strong> are supported while serving (1 Timothy 5:9-10).</p>
            <p><strong>Members</strong> are all believers, active in the body (1 Corinthians 12). This community-focused structure emphasizes service under Christ's authority.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="rc-explanation" class="hidden">
            <p>The Roman Catholic Church follows a hierarchical structure with the <strong>Pope</strong> as the supreme head, successor to St. Peter.</p>
            <p><strong>Cardinals</strong> serve as the Pope's principal counselors and elect new Popes. <strong>Archbishops</strong> oversee provinces and <strong>Bishops</strong> lead dioceses.</p>
            <p><strong>Priests</strong> administer sacraments and lead parishes, assisted by <strong>Deacons</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Religious Orders</strong> form communities dedicated to specific charisms and ministries. The <strong>Laity</strong> comprises all baptized members who aren't ordained clergy.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="baptist-explanation" class="hidden">
            <p>Baptist churches emphasize <strong>Christ</strong> as head and the <strong>Bible</strong> as the primary authority, with a distinctive congregational polity.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Congregation</strong> governs democratically with each member having an equal vote. The <strong>Pastor</strong> leads and teaches while <strong>Deacons</strong> serve as ministry leaders.</p>
            <p><strong>Committees</strong> handle specific functions within the church. <strong>Associations</strong> and <strong>Conventions</strong> are voluntary fellowships with no authority over local churches.</p>
            <p>Baptist churches emphasize local church autonomy, priesthood of all believers, and voluntary cooperation.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- New Testament Popups -->
    <div class="popup" id="popup-christ"><p><strong>Christ:</strong> The divine head and ultimate authority of the church, whose leadership is inherent and eternal. His role as the foundation of all spiritual governance is attested in Ephesians 1:22 and Colossians 1:18.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-apostles"><p><strong>Apostles:</strong> Those directly commissioned by Christ to establish the church. They were eyewitnesses of Jesus' ministry and resurrection (Acts 1:21-22) and had the authority to teach, lead, and establish local churches.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-prophets"><p><strong>Prophets:</strong> Individuals gifted to speak divine revelation and instruction to the early church. They worked alongside apostles to establish the foundational teaching of the church (Ephesians 2:20).</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-local-church"><p><strong>Local Assembly:</strong> The gathering of believers in a specific location, functioning as an autonomous body under Christ's headship. Each local assembly had its own leadership structure while maintaining fellowship with other assemblies.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-elders"><p><strong>Elders:</strong> Also called overseers or bishops, these men were responsible for teaching and governing the local assembly (1 Timothy 3:1-7, Titus 1:5-9). They were to be exemplary in character and able to teach.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-evangelists"><p><strong>Evangelists:</strong> Believers specially gifted to proclaim the gospel message to unbelievers. Philip is identified as an evangelist in Acts 21:8, and evangelists are listed among Christ's gifts to the church in Ephesians 4:11.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-pastors"><p><strong>Pastors:</strong> Leaders who shepherd the congregation, providing spiritual care, guidance, and protection. The term "pastor" (shepherd) is closely related to the role of elders (1 Peter 5:1-4).</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-teachers"><p><strong>Teachers:</strong> Those gifted to explain and apply Scripture, helping believers understand and live out God's Word. Teaching was a crucial function in the early church (Acts 13:1).</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-members"><p><strong>Members:</strong> All believers who compose the body of Christ, each with spiritual gifts to be used for the edification of the church (1 Corinthians 12). Every member has value and purpose in the functioning of the body.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-deacons"><p><strong>Deacons:</strong> Servants dedicated to meeting practical needs within the church, allowing elders to focus on prayer and ministry of the Word (Acts 6:1-6). They are to be of good character (1 Timothy 3:8-13).</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-widows"><p><strong>Widows:</strong> Older women supported by the church who dedicated themselves to prayer and service. 1 Timothy 5:9-10 outlines qualifications for widows to be placed on the support list of the church.</p></div>

    <!-- Roman Catholic Popups -->
    <div class="popup" id="popup-pope"><p><strong>Pope:</strong> The Bishop of Rome and supreme head of the Catholic Church, considered the successor to St. Peter. He exercises spiritual authority over the global Roman Catholic Church and is regarded as Christ's representative on earth.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-cardinals"><p><strong>Cardinals:</strong> Senior ecclesiastical leaders who serve as principal counselors to the Pope and elect a new Pope upon a vacancy. They govern the Church during papal transitions and often lead major dioceses or departments of the Roman Curia.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-archbishops"><p><strong>Archbishops:</strong> Bishops who oversee an ecclesiastical province consisting of several dioceses. They have limited supervisory authority over the bishops in their province while maintaining direct authority over their own archdiocese.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-bishops"><p><strong>Bishops:</strong> Successors to the apostles who govern individual dioceses. They have the fullness of priestly ordination, allowing them to ordain priests and deacons, administer all sacraments, and teach with authority within their diocese.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-priests"><p><strong>Priests:</strong> Ordained ministers who administer most sacraments, lead parishes, and act in the person of Christ (in persona Christi) during Mass. They serve under the authority of their bishop and are responsible for pastoral care of parishioners.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-rc-deacons"><p><strong>Deacons:</strong> Ordained ministers who assist bishops and priests in liturgical functions, preaching, baptizing, witnessing marriages, and performing works of charity. Unlike priests, they cannot consecrate the Eucharist or hear confessions.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-religious-orders"><p><strong>Religious Orders:</strong> Communities of men or women who live according to specific religious rules and take vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. They include contemplative monastics, mendicant friars, and apostolic communities dedicated to education, healthcare, or social service.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-laity"><p><strong>Laity:</strong> Baptized members of the Church who are not ordained clergy. They participate in Christ's priestly, prophetic, and kingly mission through baptism and have important roles in the Church's life and mission in the secular world.</p></div>

    <!-- Baptist Popups -->
    <div class="popup" id="popup-baptist-christ"><p><strong>Christ:</strong> The sole head of the church, with direct authority over each congregation. Baptist ecclesiology emphasizes Christ's direct leadership without human intermediaries between Him and the local church.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-bible"><p><strong>Bible:</strong> The supreme authority for faith and practice in Baptist churches. The principle of "Sola Scriptura" (Scripture alone) means the Bible is the final arbiter in all matters of doctrine and church governance.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-congregation"><p><strong>Congregation:</strong> The gathered body of baptized believers who collectively make decisions through democratic processes. Baptist polity emphasizes the priesthood of all believers and congregational governance.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-pastor"><p><strong>Pastor:</strong> The spiritual leader called by the congregation to preach, teach, and provide spiritual guidance. While respected for their leadership, pastors serve at the will of the congregation rather than exercising hierarchical authority.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-baptist-deacons"><p><strong>Deacons:</strong> Servants elected by the congregation to assist the pastor, care for members, and handle practical matters of church life. They often function as a leadership council but remain accountable to the congregation.</p></div>
    <div class="popup" id="popup-committees"><p><strong>Committees:</strong> Groups appointed by the congregation to oversee specific areas of ministry such as finance, buildings, missions, education, and worship. They report to and make recommendations to the full congregation.</p></div>
