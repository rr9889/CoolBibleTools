        <h3 id="explanation-title">New Testament Church Structure</h3>
        <div id="nt-explanation">
            <p>This chart reflects the biblical model where <strong>Christ</strong> is the head (Ephesians 1:22). <strong>Apostles</strong> and <strong>Prophets</strong> are foundational, equipping the early church (Ephesians 2:20, 4:11).</p>
            <p>Each <strong>Local Assembly</strong> is autonomous (Acts 14:23), led by <strong>Elders</strong> (1 Timothy 3:1-7) who oversee and teach, often including <strong>Pastors</strong> (1 Peter 5:2).</p>
            <p><strong>Evangelists</strong> spread the gospel (Acts 21:8), and <strong>Teachers</strong> instruct (Acts 13:1). <strong>Deacons</strong> serve practical needs (Acts 6:1-6), and <strong>Widows</strong> are supported while serving (1 Timothy 5:9-10).</p>
            <p><strong>Members</strong> are all believers, active in the body (1 Corinthians 12). This community-focused structure emphasizes service under Christ's authority.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="rc-explanation" class="hidden">
            <p>The Roman Catholic Church follows a hierarchical structure with the <strong>Pope</strong> as the supreme head, successor to St. Peter.</p>
            <p><strong>Cardinals</strong> serve as the Pope's principal counselors and elect new Popes. <strong>Archbishops</strong> oversee provinces and <strong>Bishops</strong> lead dioceses.</p>
            <p><strong>Priests</strong> administer sacraments and lead parishes, assisted by <strong>Deacons</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Religious Orders</strong> form communities dedicated to specific charisms and ministries. The <strong>Laity</strong> comprises all baptized members who aren't ordained clergy.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="baptist-explanation" class="hidden">
            <p>Baptist churches emphasize <strong>Christ</strong> as head and the <strong>Bible</strong> as the primary authority, with a distinctive congregational polity.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Congregation</strong> governs democratically with each member having an equal vote. The <strong>Pastor</strong> leads and teaches while <strong>Deacons</strong> serve as ministry leaders.</p>
            <p><strong>Committees</strong> handle specific functions within the church. <strong>Associations</strong> and <strong>Conventions</strong> are voluntary fellowships with no authority over local churches.</p>
            <p>Baptist churches emphasize local church autonomy, priesthood of all believers, and voluntary cooperation.</p>
